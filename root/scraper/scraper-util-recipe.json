I’ve been meaning to try mashed cauliflower after seeing it make the rounds on Pinterest for some time so I gave it a whirl in my food processor (pun intended) and found it to be pretty delicious!  It would be a great side dish in place of traditional mashed potatoes this Thanksgiving.I added roasted garlic to the recipe to give the cauliflower mash a richer flavor.  It’s easy to roast garlic in a few steps.Simply preheat your oven to 400 degrees, peel off the outer layers of the garlic bulb skin, leaving the skins of the individual cloves intact.
