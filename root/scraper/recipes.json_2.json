At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere.

If it is just too sticky to get into a ball, add a small amount of flour, but only a tablespoon or maximum two, you dont want to dilute the sweetness too much.

Don't be stingy - you want a crust with a little heft because you want to be able to both taste and feel it.  Also, don't be too heavy-handed - you want to press the crust in so that the pieces cling to one another and knit together when baked, but you don't want to press so hard that the crust loses its crumbly texture.
