### What went well?
- Individual sub-teams worked well 
- Specific tasks on GH Issues helped clarify objectives
- Sprints were very productive working sessions
- Allocation of work was well organized
- Mob programming sessions also created productive environments
- Communication over Slack was extremely smooth
### What didn't go so well?
- We had numerous linting errors for our Windows users
- Not everyone was familiar with PR testing and how to approach PR reviews
### How can we do things differently?
- Each member should test their own PR on Netlify before asking for a review
- In accordance with checking their own PR, members should also check if commits passed all tests before marking for review
  - Members can also ask for help if they are struggling to get their commits to pass
- Write more E2E and Unit tests to make testing new changes much easier
### What do we do next?
- Domain specific features 
- Application redesign, includes
  - Mobile responsiveness
  - Desktop responsiveness
  - Adding UI/UX elements to 'beautify' our application
- Bug testing and bug fixing
