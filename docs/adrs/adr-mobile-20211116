# Mobile Styling

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Mihir Gupta, Patrick Brown, Seeraj Somla, Sid Madduri, Oliver Korchnoy, Brandon Chen
* Date: 2021-11-16

## Context and Problem Statement

Many people use their phones and other mobile devices to access recipes while cooking, since it is easier and less bulky (in comparison to a desktop). However, styling for mobile will require significant developer effort.

## Decision Drivers 

* Consumers will appreciate mobile UI and use our app more
* Higher workload on developers
* Need to prototype and build mobile UI

## Considered Options

* Full mobile UI support
* Select mobile UI support
* No mobile UI support

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Full mobile UI support because we felt it was the best way to serve our customers and this feature was too important to ignore. While it will require extra effort, we believe making the application usable on mobile devices will increase user retention.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* User experience is greatly improved for a large subset of users

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Extra developer effort may prevent implementation of a few "reach" features
