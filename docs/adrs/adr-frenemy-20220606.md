- Status: accepted
- Deciders: Mihir Gupta, Angie Thai
- Date: 2022-06-06

## Context and Problem Statement

We have an opportunity to integrate feedback from Team 8 and should take full advantage of their valuable advice.

## Decision Drivers

- We need to implement their feedback
- There is a limit to how much we can implement due to time limits/bandwidth constraints

## Considered Options

### Developer Reviewer
- Add deprecated issue tag
- config files in one folder
- add difficulty as tag
- clean up docs branches
- minification

### End User Reviewer
- overflow issue for a few buttons
- dialog boxes for user feedback are harsh
- use more descriptive error messages
- make it clearer that a recipe can be either imported or created
- some fields should be optional when importing a recipe
- search bar seems large and out of place
- scroll bar in cards

## Decision Outcome

We chose to fix the following issues:
### Developer Reviewer
- Add deprecated issue tag
- add difficulty as tag
- clean up docs branches

### End User Reviewer
- overflow issue for a few buttons
- dialog boxes for user feedback are harsh
- use more descriptive error messages
- make it clearer that a recipe can be either imported or created
- some fields should be optional when importing a recipe
- search bar seems large and out of place

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- enhanced user experience
- user can self-diagnose issues easier due to better error messages
